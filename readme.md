# Website Factory

This project is a full stack website which has the infrastructure built up, but no business logic.
It is meant to be replicated as the starting point for a new project.
It's an opinionated boilerplate which provides solutions to all the necessary parts of a website.

* Separate frontend (React) and backend (Django) applications, deployed with a CDN and using REST API.
* Over 100 hours of development time into a functioning skeleton website.
* Web app is fully functional on mobile browser.
* User registration with email verification and authentication with JWT.
* Backend connects with a PostgreSQL database.
* Jupyter backend facilitates development of database, data scrapers, and machine learning.
* Next Steps: implement websockets for chat or games.

### How To Use

1. Download the codebase from github with the Code button.

2. Prepare a new repo on github and push the starting project to it.

3. Deploy the frontend and backend to verify they are working.

4. Customize with your own business logic.
